# Python-Data-CF

This repo features two projects done with python: 

1. Analysis of Influenza data to determine staffing strategy

Objectives:
Explore different types of data visualizations, their use cases and best practices incl. accessibility
Learning to use Tableau for data visualizations incl. dashboard creation and storytelling
Case: 
Develop a data-driven strategy for a medical staffing agency which provides temporary support during influenza season in the U.S.: Determine when to send staff, and how many, to each state. 
We want to focus on analyzing influenza mortality trends and demographic data
Data: 
Subset of publicly available U.S. health data: 
Influenza deaths by geography (CDC)
Population demographics (U.S. Census Bureau)
Influenza lab test results (CDC FluView)
Flu shot rates in children (CDC)

2. Analysis of Drivers of Excellence in Higher Education

Objective:
The goal of this project is to explore which factors shape a universityâ€™s global ranking.
Mainly we will look at the effect of national expenditure* on the average ranking of universities considered in the Times ranking. 
We will also look at the factors that contribute directly to the overall world rank, based on the established Times ranking: How do factors such as teaching quality and research performance influence each other and overall score of a university. 
Data Source:
Using open data from multiple sources, including the Times Higher Education and Center for World University Rankings datasets, this analysis examines patterns across more than 1,000 universities worldwide.
Approach
We begin with exploratory analysis in Python, continue through geospatial, supervised ML (regression), unsupervised ML (k-means clustering), time series techniques and end with the presentation in an interactive Tableau story.
